Introducing NimbleAI: Your AI Chat Assistant
NimbleAI is an AI-powered chat assistant designed to help businesses reply instantly to customers across WhatsApp, Instagram, and websites. It leverages advanced AI language models to understand natural language, respond based on your FAQs and policies, and is a major step up from older, rule-based chatbots.

Core Features and Capabilities

Instant Replies on All Channels: NimbleAI seamlessly integrates with WhatsApp Business, Instagram DMs, and your website chat via an easy-to-install widget.

Intelligent Answering: It can be trained on your FAQs and product information (like materials, sizing, and availability) to answer complex product and policy questions.

Contextual & Multilingual: Unlike older bots, NimbleAI understands context, supports English and Hindi out of the box, and can handle a wide variety of queries without manual scripting.

Lead Generation & Escalation: The bot automatically collects leads (emails/phone numbers) and, if it can’t answer a query or a human is needed, it will escalate the conversation to your support team or create a follow-up ticket.

Customization: You can fully customize the responses and the tone of voice to perfectly match your brand.
